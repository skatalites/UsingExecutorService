# UsingExecutorService
Use of the inteface ExecutorService

This simple example shows how to use ExecutorService

     1. getting an instance from Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
     2. using the method execute to submit 2 simple tasks

One thing to have in mind is these tasks are running sequentially :)
